# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Twin Manager: a minimalistic two-pane TUI file manager written in Go, built with
[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) (MVU framework) and
[Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) (styling). Linux-focused (drive
detection reads `/proc/mounts`, unmounting shells out to `umount`).

## Commands

The package is split across multiple files in `package main` at the repo root, so always
build/run the package (`.`), not an individual file.

```bash
go run .              # run the app
go build .            # build the ./twin binary
go vet ./...          # static checks
gofmt -l .            # check formatting
go test ./...         # run the tests
```

`fs_test.go` covers the filesystem helpers with `t.TempDir()`. `update_test.go` drives
`Update` with key messages and runs the returned commands (see its `send` helper), which is
how to test anything that goes through the modal flow.

## Architecture

The app follows Bubble Tea's Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern, split across files by
responsibility rather than by feature:

- `model.go` — the `model` struct (whole app state) and `pane` struct (one of the two
  directory panes: path, files, cursor, viewport, selection, search query). `initialModel()`
  builds the starting state; `Init()` kicks off the initial directory loads for both panes.
- `update.go` — all `Update()` logic. This is the core control flow file. The top of `Update`
  is a chain of mutually-exclusive modal states checked in order — `isCreatingFolder`,
  `isDeleting`, `isConfirmingOverwrite`, `isFavoritesOpen` (with nested `isConfirmingUnmount`
  / `isConfirmingRemoveFav` sub-states), `isPreviewing` — each intercepting key input for its
  own modal UI before falling through to normal two-pane navigation. Below that chain is a
  second switch that handles async result messages (`directoryLoadedMsg`, `fileOperationMsg`,
  etc.) that apply regardless of mode. Pane-local navigation (cursor movement, active search,
  entering directories) lives in the `pane.update()` method at the bottom of the file.
- `commands.go` — `tea.Cmd` constructors that perform actual I/O (filesystem ops, `xdg-open`,
  `umount`, clipboard) inside a returned closure and report results via a message type. Follow
  this pattern for new I/O: never mutate model state directly from a command closure — return
  a message and handle it in `Update`.
- `msg.go` — message types returned by commands (e.g. `directoryLoadedMsg`, `fileDeletedMsg`,
  `fileConflictMsg`, `previewReadyMsg`) that `Update` switches on.
- `fs.go` — filesystem helpers with no Bubble Tea dependency: `readDirectory` (sorts dirs
  first, injects a synthetic `..` entry), recursive `copyFile`/`copyDir`, `getMountedDrives`
  (parses `/proc/mounts`, filters to `/media`, `/mnt`, `/run/media`), `getStandardPaths` (home
  + XDG-style user dirs for the favorites list).
- `keys.go` — `KeyMap`/`Shortcut`: every action has a canonical `alt+<letter>` binding plus an
  optional F-key alias. `GetAliasMap()` maps F-key aliases back to their canonical key string;
  `Update` resolves incoming key events through this map before switching on `m.keyMap.X.Key`,
  so a new shortcut must be added to `KeyMap` (and `GetShortcuts()`) rather than matched as a
  raw string.
- `view.go` — `View()` and the render helpers for the two panes, status bar, hints bar, and the
  full-screen preview/favorites overlays. Overlays replace one or both panes rather than
  layering on top.
- `styles.go` — all `lipgloss.Style` definitions used by `view.go`.
- `utils.go` — small pure helpers (`fuzzyMatch` for active search, `calculateWrappedLines` for
  preview text wrapping).

### Key conventions

- File operations (copy/move) always operate from the *active* pane to the *inactive* pane's
  current path. Targets come from `operationTargets`: the selection, or the file under the
  cursor when nothing is selected. Selections are cleared on copy/move/delete.
- The synthetic `..` entry has `IsParent` set and is never a target: it can't be selected,
  deleted, copied or moved. Use `IsParent`, not `Name == ".."`.
- Copy/move is plan → resolve → execute. `planTransferCmd` runs `planBatch`, which sorts the
  batch into clean files, conflicts and rejected files (`..`, source == destination, a
  directory into itself) without touching anything. `Update` then asks y/n/A(ll)/s(kip all)
  per conflict (`resolveConflicts`) and only when every conflict is decided runs
  `transferFilesCmd` once for the clean files plus the ones chosen for overwriting. Esc
  cancels the whole batch. `transferFiles` re-checks the same safety rules.
- Directory reloads pass an optional `focusPath` so the cursor can be restored to a specific
  entry after the reload (e.g. focus the newly created folder, or the parent's own path when
  navigating up via `..`).
- Modal UI state (creating folder, deleting, confirming overwrite, favorites panel, preview) is
  mutually exclusive; when adding a new modal, add a branch to the mode chain at the top of
  `Update` and make sure it returns before falling through to normal pane key handling.

## CVC (Continuity/Version Context) MCP

If the `cvc` MCP server is installed and available (tools named `mcp__cvc__*`), use it to track
reasoning across the session:

- Call `mcp__cvc__get_context` for a file before editing it, to see whether it's clean or has an
  outstanding dirty/patch state from a prior session.
- After completing a non-trivial reasoning step, investigation, or fix, call
  `mcp__cvc__commit_thought` with the task, your reasoning (including what you ruled out and
  why), and the response/action taken. Do this especially when the fix wasn't obvious from
  reading the current code alone (e.g. required digging through `git log`/`git blame`/merge
  history), so the "why" is preserved for future sessions.
- Use `mcp__cvc__read_history` when picking up unfamiliar or in-progress work to see what
  reasoning already happened before re-deriving it.
- If the `cvc` MCP tools are not present in the tool list, skip this section entirely — do not
  attempt to install or configure it unprompted.
